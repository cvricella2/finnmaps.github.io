            Finn passed away from hemangiosarcoma in July 2023 at 11 years of age. He was a great dog and friend
            who is deeply missed. This site was originally for Finnmaps, a silly web mapping application
            I built to show places Finn had been and his ratings for those places.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finnmaps was inexpensive to keep running and required little upkeep, but I've come to feel that the money is
            better spent elsewhere. With that in mind, I've taken down the mapping application and will donate the funds
            I was using to maintain it to the <a href="https://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/">Morris Animal Foundation</a>.
            The foundation supports veternairy studies for a variety of animals, including dogs and hemangiosarcoma.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day, I plan to rebuild the site using cheaper, open-source options for map data storage and APIs, along with
            a more
            affordable server setup &mdash; or perhaps no backend at all to eliminate that cost. I'll keep the original
            repository up
            for anyone interested in it.
        </p>
        <p>Rest in peace Finn, thanks for everything.</p>
